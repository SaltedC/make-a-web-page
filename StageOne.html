			<div class="Highlights">
					<p> 1. What is the web?</p>
						<div class="HighlightText">
							<p> The internet was created in the 1980s and now has more than 30 billion pages, mostly HTML documents.  It is the largest computer network in the world.  Web pages are stored on servers.  Browsers on indiviual computers send requests for pages in HTTP through the internet to servers.</p>
						</div>
					<p> 2. What is HTML?</p>
						<div class="HighlightText">
							<p> HTML, short for <em>hyper text markup language</em>, is the main document type of the web, and is considered the "glue" of the web.  The text content is what is being viewed, and the HTML <em>markup</em> dictates how that content appears on the screen.</p>
						</div>
					<p> 3. HTML tags and elements</p>
						<div class="HighlightText">
							<p> HTML documents are made of <em> elements</em>.  Tags denote the beginning and end of elements.  However, there are many <em> void  elements </em> which do not require an end tag.  Attributes modify elements.</p>  
							<p>Elements can be inline, block, or container elements.  Inline elements relate to that line of the document.  Block elements form an invisible box around the text they contain, and can have associated height and width.</p>
						</div>
					<p> 4. Computers are stupid</p>
						<div class="HighlightText">
							<p> Ok, computers are not really stupid.  They simply operate based upon a given set of rules, and require precise input to operate as expected.</p>
						</div>

			<div class="LessonTitle">Lesson Two: Creating a Structured Document with HTML</div>
			<div class="Highlights">
					<p> 1. The web is boxes!</p>
						<div class="HighlightText">
							<p> Although there appear to be many different shapes on the web, they can all be thought of as boxes.  Even the most complicated webpages can be conceptualized as a series of boxes within boxes.</p>
						</div>
					<p> Document Object Model</p>
						<div class="HighlightText">
							<p>Using the convention Document Object Model a browser turns those nested boxes into a series into a branching, tree-like model.  If pages are well written, it is easy to follow this tree.</p>
						</div>
					<p>3. How does the browser know how to display those boxes?</p>
						<div class="HighlightText">
							<p> HTML, CSS, and Javascript are the three main languages of the web.  It can help to think of these languages as components of a house.  The HTML is like the walls of a the house.  It provides the structure.  CSS is more like the furnishings, or style of the house.  Javascript allows interactivity.  It is similar to a garage door opener or a programmable thermostat.</p>
						</div>
					<p>4.  Developer Tools</p>
						<div class="HighlightText">
							<p>Browsers' developer tools allow us to peek inside websites' code.  This is an incredibly powerful learning tool.</p>

		<div class="Lesson">
			<div class="LessonTitle">Lesson Three: Adding Style with CSS</div>
			<div class="Highlights">
					<p>1. Don't repeat yourself</p>
						<div class="HighlightText">
							<p>This is the most important rule of good code.  CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.  The cascading part means the most specific rule will apply to an element.  We can use this to reduce repetition.</p>
						</div>
					<p>2. Adding CSS to a webpage</p>
						<div class="HighlightText">
							<p>There are three ways to add CSS to a webpage.  The most straightforward way is to write the CSS inline with the HTML code.  This quickly becomes sloppy because it makes very repetitive code.  CSS can be added in the head of an HTML file.  This works best for smaller pages.  For larger projects it is best to link the HTML page to a separate CSS style sheet.</p>
						</div>
					<p>3. How to arrange those boxes</p>
						<div class="HighlightText">
							<p>div tags are block elements, which means they automatically are set to the entire width of the page.  To allow side-by-side placement of blocks, use flex box attribute in the parent element.</p>
